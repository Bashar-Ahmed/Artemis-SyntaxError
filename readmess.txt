Problem Statement
To generate a random maze and solve it using Recursive Backtracing algorithm
To solve a pre generated maze using Dijkstra's algorithm

Applications And Libraries Used:
Python
PyCharm
OpenCV

Future Prospects

Aiming to Implement the maze in such a way that no closed loops are formed, making way for more than 1 possible solution path.
By further improving this rudimentary algorithm we can use this in navigation apps to find the shortest path between any two places
Such a case can be very helpful in emergency scenarios, eg: Intelligent Traffic control to make ways for Ambulances, Firetrucks,etc.
Using Machine Learning for the same, to develop a faster, more efficient solver.
